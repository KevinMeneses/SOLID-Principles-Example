# PoC SOLID Principles
SOLID is an acronym and each letter is one principle about good practices in software development and coding,
especially for Object-Oriented Programming.

## Single Responsibility Principle

This principle consists of having just one responsibility per class or module. In other words, a class should
only have one reason to change.

## Open Closed Principle

This principle consists of having entities that are open for extension and closed for modification.

## Liskov Substitution Principle

This principle establishes that a parent class must be interchangeable with any of its child classes
and keep working correctly, because the child classes must implement or override all the methods of its parent.

## Interface Segregation Principle

This principle establishes that a class that implements an interface should override all its methods and there should
not be god interfaces but small interfaces for specific stuff.

## Dependency Inversion Principle

This principle establishes that high-level modules should not depend on low-level modules, neither
low-level modules on other low-level modules, but both should depend on abstractions.
