# PoC Principios SOLID
SOLID is an acronym and each letter is one principle about good practices in software development and coding,
specially for Object-Oriented Programming.

## Single Responsibility Principle

In the current example we explain the single responsibility principle from the SOLID principles:
this principle consists in having just one responsibility per class or module. In other words a class should
only have one reason to change.

## Open Closed Principle

In the current example we explain the open closed principle from the SOLID principles:
this principle consists in having entities that are open for extension and closed for modification.

## Liskov Substitution Principle

In the current example we explain the Liskov substitution principle from the SOLID principles:
this principle establishes that a parent class must be interchangeable with any of its child classes
and keep working correctly, because the child classes must implement or override all the methods of its parent.

## Interface Segregation Principle

In the current example we explain the interface segregation principle from the SOLID principles:
this principle establishes that a class that implements an interface should override all its methods and there should
not be god interfaces but small interfaces for specific stuff.

## Dependency Inversion Principle

In the current example we explain the dependency inversion principle from the SOLID principles:
this principle establishes that high level modules should not depend on low level modules, neither
low level modules on other low level modules, but both should depend on abstractions.
